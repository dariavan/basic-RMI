RMI is all about stubs and skeletons. Enjoy!

The skeleton is an object, acts as a gateway for the server side object. All the incoming requests are routed through it. When the skeleton receives the incoming request, it does the following tasks:

It reads the parameter for the remote method
It invokes the method on the actual remote object, and
It writes and transmits (marshals) the result to the caller.
